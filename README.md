# Biscuits' THE BUTTON (v1.0)

### THE IDEA:
- every button press adds 1 cent
- timer until 5/18 (this is about 31500 minutes as I write this)
- every button press removes 4 minutes from the timer
- you cannot press the button twice in a row
    - someone else has to press the button for you to be able to press it again
    - the button has a 15s cooldown for yourself (so no two people can keep spamming it really fast)
- you get your own link to the button, that is ONLY yours
    - this means you can press the button ANYWHERE, on your PC, on your phone, in bed, at work, etc...
- the total and the timer update LIVE

### SO WHO PAYS?
- pressing the button puts you on top of the list
- the amount you pay depends on how close to the bottom of the list
    - bottom pays 50%
    - 2nd bottom pays 25%
    - 3rd 12.5%
    - 4th 6.25%
    - 5th 6.25%
    - top 3 in the list pay NOTHING!!!

### POSSIBLE OTHER IDEAS:
- random chance of adding more than 1 cent
- button plays random sound effect when you press it (cause why not + stim)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
